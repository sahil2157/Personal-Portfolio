            Hello! I'm Sahil Salunkhe, a passionate web developer and problem
            solver. I have completed my Diploma in Information Technology from
            Vidyalankar Polytechnic, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s
            Degree in Engineering (B.E.) at A.P. Shah Institute of Technology.
            <br/>
            My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity
            about how websites and applications are built. As I learned more, my
            passion for web development grew. I find joy in solving complex
            problems and turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital
            solutions.
