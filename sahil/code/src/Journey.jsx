            For our final year project, we developed Innovest, a platform that
            bridges the gap between investors, startups, and public users.
            Investors can connect with promising startups, while public users
            play a role in idea validation by testing concepts. The project was
            lauded for its innovation and practical approach, showcasing strong
            teamwork and creativity.

            website from scratch. This project gave me valuable experience in
            web development and teamwork, and I gained a lot from collaborating
            closely with my peers to create a fully functional site.
